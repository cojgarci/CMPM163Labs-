The first cube, I used the existing fragment shader and added two more colors. I then align them with vUv.x and vUv.y.
For the second cube, I loaded an excisting material in the Three.js and gave it a shine with a certain color.
For the third cube, I created a fragment shader that used two colors to mix them at a certain vertex on the 3D model.
For the fourth cube, I loaded another material that created a flat color and gave the illusion of different colors being present.
